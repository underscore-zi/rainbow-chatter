# Rainbow Chatter 

Make all your Twitch chats more colorful by changing your user color after every message you send.

## This is a violation of Twitch's terms, use at your own risk.

### It may seem harmless, and in my opinion it is. However Twitch absolutely can ban your account for using their GraphQL API without authorization as this extension does.

This is made for Firefox. As far as I understand it doesn't do anything that isn't allowed on Chrome however I couldn't get any content script loading at all under Manifest V3 despite it still being supported, so I just gave up trying. In theory with the right permissions this should work under V3/Chrome also.

## Usage

1. Download the .zip of this repository
2. Extract to the location of your choice
3. Load the folder as an "unpacked" extension into Firefox (Google for more specific instructions)
